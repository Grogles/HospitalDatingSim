*You make your way to the lobby to clean up the 3972917291st mess of the day.*
*You see a nurse that you have never seen before struggle with moving their heavy cart.*
*You notice that a vial with a toxic liquid is about to fall over onto the ground,*
*which could potentially harm them*
*You quickly catch the vial before it shatters*
*You look up to find the nurse looking down at you with an unreadable expression on their face*
“Damn…I could have gone home if it got on me…”
*their face expresses disappointment*
*You think that’s kinda messed up, but you still laugh*
*Their lip quirks upwards in a smug smile*
“I’ll see you around”
*They exit*
