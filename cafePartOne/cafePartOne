You go to the cafe in the hospital lobby and order the coffee of your choice
On the way out, you bump into someone and oh no! You spill your coffee all over their chest!
“UGH! LOOK WHAT YOU DID. THIS IS A LIMITED EDITION GUCCI TIE…AND MY SUIT IT'S RUINED!”
You look up to see the very handsome CEO of the hospital, Edmund. Yikes!
“WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?”
