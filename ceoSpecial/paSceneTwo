Fine then, I’ll leave!
*You turn to leave the room, but before you could grab the door handle,*
*Columns of steel bars slide down and block the door*
UGHBSB@$%^%#VYEVQYI! This can’t be real
*He rolls his eyes, loosens his tie,* 
*And slides down the wall to sit on the ground in a defeated demeanour.*
*You decide to sit against the same wall but as far as possible from him.*
*The both of you refuse to talk to each other. The silence is deafening*
*After a couple of minutes of silence, the lights go out in the room*
“AAAAAAA! AAAAAA! AAAAA!” 
What happened?? Why are you squealing?! Quit it!
“WHY IS IT DARKKKKKK?!?!!” 
Oh. my. god. Are you afraid of the dark??
“N-no…i have no idea what you’re talking about”
*Sigh. You pull out your phone and turn the flashlight on to provide some light to calm him down*
*You see him take a deep breath and visibly calm down.*
*fter a few minutes, he turns his head away from you and murmurs something softly.*
Pardon?
*He murmurs something again, which sounds a lot like “thank you”*
*You smile smugly*
Sorry? What was that again?
"I SAID THANK YOU"
*The room is silent once again*
So…have you always been scared of the dark?
*The CEO reluctantly recants the tale of his fear of the dark, growing more comfortable around you.*
*You continue asking him questions about himself and he asks you a couple about yourself as well*
*You notice that you both have unknowingly moved closer to each other while you were talking.*
*You both continue talking until you notice that your phone’s battery is at 1%.*
*Your phone dies all of a sudden and you can hear him panic.*
