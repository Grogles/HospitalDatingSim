*You are organizing the tools in the Janitor’s closet when a Lockdown occurs in the hospital.*
“CODE RED! LOCKDOWN! CODE RED!LOCKDOWN!”
*You hear the CEO over the PA system.*
“Doctors, to the cafeteria. Nurses, to the lobby. Patients, stay in your rooms”
*Wait but what about the janitors? Where do you go?*
*You know that the doctors, including your best friend will be in the cafeteria.*
*You know that the nurses, including the new one you met earlier, will be in the lobby.*
*You know that your ex will still be in Room 2324*
*And you also know that the CEO is probably in the PA room.*
