*He looks down at you and scoffs* 
Like you could ever afford it
*You begin to feel a little upset about his attitude*
Oh I’m sorry! *you say sarcastically*
Or you could pay for my coffee, since you can probably afford it, considering YOU ran into ME!
How DARE you speak to me that way! I am the CEO, you’re just a mere janitor!
Do you even know what the ECONOMY is?
Econ…Eco…Eco-what? That’s not even a real word. I’m not stupid yknow!
*He looks at you in disbelief*
*You fish out a $5 bill and push it onto his hand* 
Here, sorry for your loss!
*You exit the cafe*
*He stares at the $5 bill in his hand and turns to watch you go*
