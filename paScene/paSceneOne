*You open the door, hurry inside and shut the door immediately*
*The CEO sees you and seethes in anger*
“WHAT…ARE…YOU…DOING HERE!!” 
You didn’t mention where I am supposed to go
"exCUSE mE??"
You didn’t say where the janitors are supposed to hide
*He looks at you in disbelief*
“So you decided to come HERE??!”
“I thought I could keep you company too”
*You realize he really does not want to be in a room with you*
