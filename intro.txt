THUD!
*You watch as a bedpan falls, spilling its contents on the ground*
Fiddlesticks! Look at this mess!
*You grab your mop and immediately clean up.* 
You have been the head janitor at this hospital for 5 years. 
However...you are also the only janitor ever since the hospital laid off the other janitors. 
There has been a lot of tension and you are very stressed about keeping your job.
Fortunately, since the hosiptal is small, you are very close to the other staff. 
You hope to run into some of them today!
