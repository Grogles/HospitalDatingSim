*You go to Room 2324 to clean up the mess in that room*
*You enter the room and notice that a large vase of flowers is shattered on the ground.*
*Dirt, water, and shards of the vase are everywhere on the floor.*
*You get started on cleaning up the shards of glass with your broom.*
All of a sudden, the wind blowing from an open window, shifts the curtains around the hospital bed*
*You get a glimpse of the patient in the room*
OH…MY…GOD!
*It’s your ex, Percy, from high school??!*
*He notices you from his bed, and he smirks at you before the breeze pushes the curtains back into place,*
*And hides him from view*
*You are frozen in shock. You have so many questions.*
*Does he remember you? What is he doing in the hospital? Why does he look so hot?*
