“Sounds good”
*You both exit the cafeteria and she skips around the corridors excitedly*
How was your day?
“It was good. I performed CPR on a kid that swallowed a fishbowl…He lived!”
*Swallowed…a fishbowl? You have so many questions you want to ask, but you decide to let it go*
“How was yours?”
It wa-
*all of a sudden, you trip on the stairs as you both go down*
*You close your eyes and brace yourself for the fall…which never came.*
“Oh my god! Are you okay??!”
*You open your eyes and find yourself staring into your best friend’s beautiful brown eyes above you.*
*She is holding you by the waist to prevent you from collapsing on the stairs.*
*You remain to be in shock but find yourself thinking that she is so beautiful.*
*Has she always been this gorgeous?*
*After a few seconds, or what feels like years, she clears her throat and sets you down onto your feet*
