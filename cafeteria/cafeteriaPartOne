*You go to the cafeteria to meet your best friend of 20 years, who also happens to be a doctor in this hospital*
“Hey! Over here!”
*You hear her cheerful voice and turn to meet her*
*Her grin widens as you approach her at her table* 
“It’s a little loud in here. Isn’t it beautiful outside? Do you want to eat lunch outside instead?” 
*You glance outside the windows and see that it is very sunny*
